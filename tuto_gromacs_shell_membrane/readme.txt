	Inside of this archive you will find bash script, which can be used as the tutorial of the molecular dynamics simulations of the lipid bilayer at different physical conditions. In this examples you can perform molecular modeling of POPC lipid bilayer at different temperatures (burn_bilayer.sh) in order to investigate physical behaviour of the biomembranes. Depending on your scientific creativity you can easily vary additional physical parameters of the simulations (e.g chosing different thermostats, introduction of the forces to the parts of the system) or try to adapt this scripts for your molecular systems.
It can be used as the excellent introduction to the molecular dynamics simulations of the biomembrane systems with GROMACS as well as the tutorials of the shell scripting applied on the molecular modeling and computational biophysics.
