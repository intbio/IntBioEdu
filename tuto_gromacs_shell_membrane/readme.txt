	This is several bash scripts, which can be used as the tutorial of molecular dynamics simulations of various biological systems at different physical conditions. In this examples you can perform molecular modeling of POPC lipid bilayer in GROMACS at different temperatures (burn_bilayer.sh) and/or under different pressure (compress_bilayer.sh). Depending on your scientific creativity you can easily vary additional physical parameters of the simulations (e.g chosing different barostats, thermostats, introduction of the forces to the parts of the system) or try to adapt this scripts for your molecular systems.
	It can be used as the excellent introduction to the molecular dynamics simulations of the biomembrane systems with GROMACS as well as the tutorials of the shell scripting applied for molecular modeling and computational biophysics.
