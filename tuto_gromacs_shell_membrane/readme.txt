	Here you will find bash scripts, which can be used as the tutorials of the molecular dynamics simulations with GROMACS at different physical conditions. In this examples you can perform molecular modeling of POPC lipid bilayer at different temperatures (burn_bilayer.sh) and pressure (compress_bilayer.sh). Depending on your scientific creativity you can easily vary additional physical parameters of the simulations (e.g chosing different thermostats, introduction of the forces to the parts of the system) or try to adapt this scripts for your molecular systems. It can be used as the introduction to molecular dynamics simulations with GROMACS as well as the tutorial of the shell scripting applied on the molecular modeling and computational biophysics.
