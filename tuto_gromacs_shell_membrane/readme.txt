	This is several bash scripts, which can be used as the tutorial of molecular dynamics simulations of various biological systems at different physical conditions. In this examples you can perform molecular modeling of POPC lipid bilayer in GROMACS at different temperatures (burn_bilayer.sh) and/or under different pressure (compress_bilayer.sh). All scripts should be executed at the local Linux machine in order to create the folder with simulations, which is going to send on the server for calculations. Depending on your scientific creativity you can easily vary additional physical parameters of the simulations (e.g chosing different barostats, thermostats, adding the forces on selected parts of the system). It is also possible to adapt these scripts for your molecular systems. It can be used as the excellent introduction to the molecular dynamics simulations of the biomembrane systems with GROMACS as well as the tutorials of the shell scripting applied for molecular modeling and computational biophysics.
